Snake clone for GBA (written in C)


I am indebted to TONC's tutorial and Kyle Halladay's explanation of his own work with GBA homebrew. As such, much of the code (all that has to do with hardware interaction) is from TONC, as well as the makefile. The queue code is from another website. The rest, the actual functioning of the game and the graphics work, is all me.

Hope you enjoy! Let me know if you encounter any bugs.
